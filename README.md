TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project Overview This project, developed as part of an internship at Prodigy Infotech, aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets to derive meaningful insights into public opinion on various topics. The analysis involves collecting tweets using the Tweepy API, preprocessing the text data to clean and prepare it for analysis, and employing machine learning models to classify the sentiment of the tweets.

FeaturesData Collection: Fetch tweets using the kaggle

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and stopwords.

Sentiment Analysis: Implement machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Passive Aggressive Classifier, and CatBoost Classifier to perform sentiment classification.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV for better performance.

Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the sentiment distribution and other insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to ensure robust sentiment classification.
